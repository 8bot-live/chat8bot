# WordPress ChatGPT Plugin - Website Chatbot

A free and simple AI chatbot plugin for WordPress that integrates with OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses to user queries. Unlike cloud-based solutions, all conversations are managed locally on your site, ensuring better control and privacy. You only need an OpenAI API key to get started. The API is a free trial, although if paid, it's about 1 cent per chat session depending what model you choose and how big your knowlegebase is.

## Features

- **Local Conversation Management** – No third-party storage; all chat history is handled within your WordPress installation.
- **OpenAI API Integration** – Simply register for an OpenAI API key and start using the chatbot.
- **Customizable Appearance** – Modify colors, text, and intro messages to match your website branding.
- **Email Notifications** – Set up email alerts for new chat sessions and customer inquiries.
- **Knowledge Base Support** – Enhance AI responses by providing custom knowledge base content tailored to your website. This is why the plugin was built.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files and upload them to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin panel under **Plugins**.
3. Navigate to **Chatbot Settings** in the WordPress dashboard.
4. Enter your OpenAI API key.
